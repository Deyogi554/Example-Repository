# ✨ Animation Project

Welcome! This repository is home to a series of original animated shorts created with love and imagination.  
Each short explores different themes, characters, and moods — from lighthearted adventures to quiet emotional moments.

# 🎬 About the Project

This is a personal animation project focused on:
- Telling unique short stories through animation
- Exploring expressive character design and smooth motion

All content is drawn and animated manually or semi-digitally, depending on the scene.
